# Learn-Python-the-Hard-Way

My solutions to exercises in [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). The book is pretty good as a hands-on introduction to writing programs in Python. It's not super comprehensive, so definitely worth supplementing with other materials.

After finishing exercise 46, I felt comfortable with Python fundamentals and moved onto other materials in the interest of time.
